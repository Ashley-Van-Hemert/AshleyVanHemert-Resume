        <div class="subheading mb-5">Liberal Studies / Education</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently 18 years old and I come from a family of 7. I am, in fact, a Native American descendant from the Sioux tribe. My great great great grandfather was a chief for our tribe and my grandpa now tells me stories about what he used to do for the tribe as a whole. I love learning about my culture and has made me appreciate more about the differences in each one. Now I recently graduated from Serrano High School with a 4.2 gpa last summer in 2020. With graduating with high honors, in high school I was on the dance team for 1 year and varsity cheer team for 3 while being a varsity captain for 1 year. By becoming a captain it has made me become more responsible and manage my time better. I was responsible for my team on getting stuff done and preparing us for weeks worth of performances and games. It also taught me how to communicate and work better with others. Working within a team means to listen to others' ideas, come to an agreement, make sure the environment is positive and support one another. By juggling school and the responsibility of being a captain it has helped me prioritize what's more important and has made me plan out my goals more accordingly. <br><br>

        Since I have graduated from high school, I started working in retail at Hobby Lobby. Since I have started this job it has taught me a lot about providing customer service. My active listening skills have improved by hearing out my customers with questions or problems they may have had during their shopping experience. It has also made me more experienced in what to do in certain situations with out of hand customers and how to handle them. Working in retail I feel is a good first job to open myself up into the career world. Working and dealing with others has made me work better with others and how to control more responsibilities that are given to me.<br><br>

        I am now currently attending UC Riverside as a freshman and I am majoring in Education. My passion has always been to work with children and help them learn and grow throughout their journey of life development. I used to work at a daycare in between summers in high school and watching them grow and seeing that spark they get when they understand a concept just makes me want to help today's children more. After receiving my bachelors degree I hope to continue my education and apply for the masters program at UCLA or continue my journey at UC Riverside. UCLA has been my dream school ever since I was a little girl and they have an amazing child and development masters program. With my degree I hope to become a kindergarten or elementary school teacher or perhaps a high school counselor. My whole goal with my future career is to brighten the minds of these children and guide high school students on the path to success for themselves.
